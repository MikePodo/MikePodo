### Hey!

My name is Michael Podolsky, and I am a senior in high school who resides in Las Vegas, Nevada. I am a musician and have been playing the guitar for 9 years. I taught myself to code due to my fascination with technology, and I'm always eager to continue my learning in order to become the best programmer I can be!
